# Overview

Enameling is quite a complex process, and much more is learned in
practice than can be adequately conveyed by books. Understanding
background is important, but a lot of technique is refined in the
'doing' that is difficult to convey through general text.

These notes serve as a sort of living document to record what is learned
during each iteration of the enameling process and will hopefully assist
in providing good advice. 

In general the notes will operate more in a list format, but will likely
sometimes deviate to be more in a paragraph format. 

# Drawing Designs and Resist

## Drawing

    -   We have been using Adobe Illustrator for the bulk of the drawing
        work. Other programs like MS Paint, Inkscape, etc. will probably
        work as well. 

## Resist

    -   Resist is applied mostly using Press n Peel transfer paper from
        techniks.com, following the directions on the website. 
    -   don't heat too hot, or for too long, otherwise the transfer ink
        will bleed and create a lower resolution image. 
    -   Occasionally the transfer paper doesn't fully transfer the
        design, and must be supplemented.
            -   Testor's paint is good for this. There might be others. 
    -   Resist should be applied as thin as possible, so it's easier to
        remove later.

# Etching

    -   Packing tape should be applied to the back side of the copper
        pieces before they are etched, otherwise etchant will get behind
        it and ruin the back. 

# Enameling

    -   Red enamel shouldn't be fired too many times. It starts to
        discolor.
    -   vibrating the wet enamel pieces against a firing rack is really
        useful for settling out the enamel. Otherwise it might be lumpy.
    -   it's generally always useful to slightly overpack the enamel and
        then grind it off with stones and sand paper.
    -   keep wet enamel away from pieces just out of the kiln. fire
        scale will pop off onto the wet enamel. no good. 

# Polishing
    
    -   when using spray lacquer, don't sand or use steel wool on it. 
    -   actually sanding is fine. I had some good success using wet 1000
        grit. but just be careful.

# Materials to Have on Hand

    -   chemicals: sodium bisulfate, sodium carbonate (to neutralize
        ferric chloride), ferric chloride
    -   sand paper (up to 1000+ grit)
    -   alundum stones, used to grind off excess enamel and smooth
        copper.

# Purchasing 

General purchasing information. There are several different online
vendors that are useful for enameling, so cataloging them all in one
place is helpful for parsing through.
