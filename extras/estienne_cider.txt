How Cider is made.

THe drinkes made of fruits that are most commonly vsed, are Cider and Perrie,
vvhich as they are pressed out of diuers sorts of Apples and Peares, so are they
differing as well in taste as in goodnesse. For to make your Cider, you must see that
your Apples be not wild ones, but garden and tame ones, growne and bred in or∣chards
carefully and diligently dressed, kept, husbanded, and ordered all the
yeare long, according to that care and diligence vvhich vve haue said to be need∣full
before in speaking of the Orchard, and yet vvithout hauing any great regard
vnto the place vvhere the Orchards are planted, and doe grow, as vvhether they be
gardens, greene-plots, arable ground, or other such like places; alwaies prouided
and foreseene, that the ground be good, and vvell seasoned. And aboue all things
such Apples* must haue a firme, solide, and fast flesh, accompanied with great store
of juice, of a pleasant smell, and delightsome taste, and of a beautifull colour: such
are these that follow, the Heroet, Ruddocke, Maligar, Rambur, Fairewife, Gastlet▪
Clanget, great Eye, Greening, Curtaine, Grosegraft, Rucke, long, sower, and
sweet Kennet, Barbarian, Rangelet, and Ado•ill. The Shortstart, Honie-meale,
and Garden-globe, notwithstanding that they be rare and singular apples, and of a
more pleasant smell, and delightsome taste, then any other sorts of Apples, yet are
they not fit to make any Cider of, as well in respect of the tendernesse and delicacie
of their flesh, as for the little and insufficient store of juice which they yeeld, not wor∣thie
the putting into the pres•e to make any quantitie of Cider of. And hereto you
may put another reason; namely, that these Apples are not so plentifull, neither grow
they in such store as others doe, and therefore it is better to keepe them to eate, or to
imploy them in broths or sirope of king Sabor, and de succis pomorum, than about the
making of any common drinke.

The most common time to gather Apples is about mid-September,* after they
haue beene partakers of Sommers heat, and receiued some small raine and gentle
vvinds from September: some being verie ripe; others yet not altogether ripe;
principally those which haue a faster and lesse delicate flesh: the greatest part
vvhereof (being kept some time) yeeldeth greater store of juice, and better conco∣cted
and digested by the vvorke and operation of their owne naturall heat. In the
gathering of them there is necessarily to be vsed cudgels and poles, except it be that
wee lay our hands to them, vvhich vvee haue a purpose to keepe: there must in
this businesse also be chosen such a day as is faire, drie, cleare, beautifull, and full of
Sunne-shine, for if they should be moist with any raine or dew▪ they would rot in
their garners.

Being gathered, they must not all of the sodaine be taken in hand to be made
into Cider, but they must be suffered to take a heat in heapes, (as the Normans call
it) and be kept some three vveekes or a moneth, more or lesse, according to their
consistence and kind, seeing vnto it in the meane time (at their owne perill) that
they rot not; as also, they may be layed on great heapes in Gardens, or vnder some
roofe open to the ayre vvhen it freezeth not, or vvhen it freezeth, to court them
with straw newly threshed, or else vvith some Mattresses or Featherbeds to keepe
them from the frost. Some during the time of the frost, couer them vvith linnen
Clothes steeped in water, and vvrung out, and these being frozen once themselues,
doe keepe that the ayre cannot passe vnto the Apples to freeze them: the best of all
it to prouide them warme garners, the •loores being layed neither with plaster nor
tiles, but with straw, hauing the windowes verie close, the doores firme and fast shut,
and all the creuises or chinkes perfectly stop to resist the entrance of the cold ayre.
And notwithstanding all this, yet you must not tarrie and waite vntill they be
throughly ripe, and almost vpon the rotting especially: but you must take your time
somewhat before that they be come to this exact maturity and height of ripenesse, for
else your cider will not proue durable, but withall will gather great quantitie of lee•, and grow couered with much vvhite mother swimming aloft: if they be frozen, then
trouble not your selfe with going about to make Cider, for hauing lost their natu∣rall
and accustomed smell and colour, they haue also lost all their force and vertue,
and so it is not possible to make any thing of them but a raw, weake, vnpleasant, vva∣terish,
vndurable, and soone sowring licour. When as therefore the apples shallbe
vvell prepared, and come to a good scantling of ripenesse, not such a o•e as is exact,
but rather of the first or second degree of ripenesse, and that they shall yeeld and
breath out a verie pleasant and sweet smell: then it shall be high time for you to
goe in hand vvith making of your Cider. Which oportunitie if you foreslow and
still stay longer for their further and exact ripening▪ they vvill vvither and fall a∣way,
and the Cider that you shal presse out of them, wil become waterish, weake, and
sowre out of hand.

There are diuers wayes vsed in pressing out this drinke made of Apples in the
countrie of Neuz:* Some doe stampe them, putting them in fats, and afterward fill
them vp with great quantitie of water, letting them ferment, boyle, and purge, so
long as vntill the water haue got the force and strength of the Cider. Others stampe
them in a morter, and after powre them together with a great quantitie of water in∣to
some fat, not giuing them any time of concoction and purging: but these two
wayes are not so much worth; this third is better than them both. First, you must
breake your Apples in peeces, and after presse them out: the way to breake them
in peeces, is to put them in a presser made •ound, and containing in compasse some
seuen or eight •adome, the said compasse and round being contriued after the man∣ner
of a trough of two foot broad and deepe at the least, in these troughes shall be
put and contayned the said apples for the better staying and keeping of them in close
together. Within these troughes there shall turne about one or two great milstones
of stone, or of some hard, massie, and weightie wood, fashioned like a wheele, car∣ried
about vvith one Oxe or Horse, or two, so as shall be sufficient for power and
strength, as we haue said in the making of Oyles. When the Apples shall be suffici∣ently
broken, you must gather into heapes the same, and cast them into •ubs for the
purpose, and there let them worke for a time as Wine doth, and when it hath
wrought, then you must draw out the juice or liquor (call it as you vvill) which
shall haue runne out of the substance without being prest, and turne it vp into ves∣sels,
whether they be pipes or hogsheads, old, or altogether new; prouided that they
haue not taken any ill taste of any vnsauourie liquor: the best vessells or caske of all
other, is that wherein there hath beene Wine, and especially white Wine, for the sa∣uour
of the Wine doth make this juice more acceptable, and more affected. The Ci∣der
that commeth voluntarily without being pressed, is the best and sweetest, though
not alwaies stronger than that which hath abode the presse: that likewise is better
and more excellent which is made without any mixture of vvater: It is true indeed,
that when apples haue a verie fast and solide pulpe, and haue not so much moisture,
but withall some sharpe relish, that then it will not be amisse to mingle some small
quantitie of vvater with them to make them breake the better, as also, after that they
be broken by force of the turning stone, euen whiles they are working in their fats,
or before they be put into their fats a working, euen at their going to the presse, there
may vvater be mixt with them, to preuent that the Cider may not be too ranke, nei∣ther
yet too sowre or greenish. The grounds of the vvorking fat shall be layed
vpon the presse interlaced with long straw, to keepe the said stamped Apples
steedie and stayed, that they slip not to and fro when they are pressed, (the Apples
by reason of their roundnesse, not being able to stay and abide vnder the doore
and other boards of the presser, except they be kept in vpon the sides with some∣thing)
and that which shall run out vpon the pressing of them, shal be tun•ed vp into
caske, and put to the former: or else, which is better, tunne it vp by it selfe, as is done
by wine, without mingling of it with that which did run out vnpressed, the pressed
being the stronger, though the vnpressed be the more pleasant and sweet. The
drosse or grosse substance remayning after the pressing, shall be put againe into the fat, and stamped, and sufficient quantitie of water powred in amongst, and it shall be
let so rest, steepe, and boyle together for the space of foure and twentie houres: after
which, there shall be made thereof spending Cider, or small drinke for the household.
For the making of this household drinke, it shall be after the rate of gathering of one
vessell thereof from so much drosse as made foure vessels of the best.

When the Cider is tunned vp into caske, you must let it boyle within the caske by
the bung-hole of the caske lest open, and thereby to purge it selfe of all his froth,
scumme, and other impurities, after the manner of wine: and when it is thus well
purged, you must bung it vp very close, and so leaue it to boile againe within his ves∣sell:
but you must see that at this time the vessell be not top full, least in the boiling it
breake the vessell. And indeed this kind of Cider is a great deale more strong than
that which boileth all his boiling with the bung of the vessell open, but somewhat
more fuming, and not so pleasant as the other: and it must lye in some cellar for the
Winter time, but in some caue in the Summer.

Cide•, as concerning the tast, doth resemble and become like vnto Wine: for at
the first it is sweet; afterward, being fined, it is somewhat sharpe; and when it is alto∣gether
fined, it hath then a sharper rellish, but yet altered from his former verdure:
euen after the manner of Wine, as being more pleasant when it is in fining, than when
it is fined.

The Cider is better to keepe than Perrie: and there are Ciders found of two or
three years old, as good, in their place, as anie Wine that is made. It is true indeed,
that it is subiect vnto the same accidents that Wine is, and it must be as heedily regar∣ded
in the piercing of it, as if it were Wine, not giuing it any ayre in the drawing of
it, if it be possible, or if you giue it any at all, to giue it when the fossest is halfe out,
causing the ayre to recoyle before the fountaine be stopt vp and shut. So soone as the
Cider vessell is emptie, you must looke that the less be not let stand in it any long
time, because that it would breed an infinite number of wormes, which would make
it to haue an ill smell and stinke, in such sort, as that it would neuer be good afterward
to keepe any Cider. And thus much for the making and keeping of Cider. Now we
will speake of the making of our choise of the Apples.

To haue excellent Cider, you must make it of sweet Apples, and that but of one or
two sorts, and both of them in his kind verie good, of a pleasant tast, and sweet smell:
and you must breake and stampe them euery sort by it selfe, but put them together vn∣der
the presser. That which is made of sweet Apples mixt amongst some sowre ones,
is not altogether so excellent good, and yet in the heat of Summer to be preferred be∣fore
the most excellent Ciders, in that it is more cleare, heateth lesse, and quencheth
thirst better. And of a certainetie experience hath taught it, that the Cider made of
sweet Apples, hauing a soft and tender flesh, is more apt to sowre, if that there be not
some sowre ones mingled amongst them, because that such sweet Apples haue but a
weake heat, and easily ouercome and wasted. But such sweet Apples as haue a fast
flesh and thick iuice, stand not in need of hauing any sowre Apples mixt with them,
to the helping of them to make good Cider. It is true, that sweet Apples yeeld lesse
Cider than sowre ones: but yet, in as much as the sweet haue the lesse iuice and the
thicker, therefore their Cider is the better, lasteth longer, nourisheth the body more,
and is a longer time in fining: But on the contrarie, those sweet Apples which haue
much iuice, doe make much Cider: but this Cider is not so good, nor making so good
nourishment, notwithstanding it be sooner fined and readie for drinking. Sowrish
Apples doe yeeld much iuice, that is waterie, thinne, and soone fined, but nourishing
verie little.

The Cider that is all neat, and of it selfe, without any mixture of water, doth fine
and become cleare more slowly than that which is made with water: In like sort it
retaineth his smell and tast a longer time, and all other the vertues and qualities of the
Apples whereof it was made: for water added but in small quantitie, after sixe
moneths once past, or if somewhat longer, yet after one yeare it causeth the Cider to
sowre, and then so much the sooner, as there shall be the greater quantitie in the mixture, as in the houshold or ordinarie drinke. Wherefore such Ciders as you
would haue to last long, must be made without water, and vse rather to mixe your
vvater vvith them vvhen they are drawne out of the vessell to drinke, if then you
find them too strong for you: and this also is the same course taken with Wine, espe∣cially
when such a sicknesse hath seised vpon the partie, as craueth a thin, weake, and
vvaterish drinke.

Ciders differ one from another, especially in colour, and •auour, or relish: for as
for their colour, some represent the scarlet as it were like vnto Claret-wine, and such
is that vvhich is made of Apples that are red vvithin and without: such also will last
long, and fine, not vnder the colour of high Clarets, and haue a taste resembling the
same somewhat a farre off, but afterward comming neere to the resembling of Hyp∣pocras.
Others are of the colour of Muscadells, and resembling the same also in re∣lish.
The greatest part of the rest draw neere to a yellow colour, and some of them
cleare as the rocke vvater.

As concerning their relish and tast, all Ciders, if they be good, should be sweet, or
a little bitter or sowre, whether they be new or old: and it is as true, that some of them
haue no more relish than vvater. Some are of an euill taste, and that either of them∣selues,
or of the ground, or of the vessell, or of the straw, or of some other such strange
cause. The sweet, as well the new as the old, and fined, are the best of all, and nou∣rish
most. But it is true withall, that the new doe swell vp a man, and cause obstru∣ctions:
The fined Ciders, are good for such as haue weake lungs, or those which are
subject to the stone, or haue vlcers in the reines or bladder. Such as are bitter, and
hold out bitter, are naught: But such bitter Cider as after becommeth sweet, is the
best of all, and lasteth long. Such as are greenish, if they continue the same colour al∣waies,
are not of any value: but if in time they change this greenenesse into a maner
of sweetnesse, then they proue good, and last long.

You may also make Cider of vvild Apples, but such Cider although that it last
longer than that vvhich is made of tame and garden apples: yet it is not so pleasant
nor profitable for the stomacke.

Good housholders doe not loose the drosse of their pressings, but (as we haue said)
cast them into vessells, and vvith a sufficient quantitie of fountaine vvater, make Ci∣der
for the houshold: many make no account of it, but cast it out to the dunghill, as∣suring
themselues that it drieth and maketh barren the place where it commeth. In
su•h places as vvhere they haue not the benefit of mill-stones, pressers, & other imple∣ments
for to make Cider, they stampe apples, but not of all sorts, but onely wild ones
with a stamper, and afterward put them thus stamped into vessells with a sufficient
quantitie of water, and this is called Cider-pinet.*

As concerning the faculties and vertues of Cider,*
they must be measured and
judged according to their taste, age, continuance, and abilitie to last, and the manner
of making of them. The taste is not to be tried onely by the sauour and relish of the
apples vvhereof they vvere made, vvhich vvere either sweet or sowre, or harsh, or of
moe tastes than one, or vvithout any taste at all: but likewise of the age thereof, in
as much as Cider if it be kept, changeth his taste,*
together vvith the time, and get∣teth
another relish, after that is fined diuers from that vvhich it had, vvhiles it was
in fining, or that it had vvhen it began to fine, after the manner of new vvine, which
when it commeth to be old, purchaseth and getteth diuers qualities together with
the time. Such Cider therefore as is sweet, because of the sweetnesse which com∣meth
of temperate heat, heateth in a meane and indifferent manner, but cooleth least
of all; and againe, it is the most nourishing of all Ciders, and the most profitable to
be vsed, especially of such as haue cold and drie stomackes, and on the contrarie, but
s••ally, profiting them which haue a hot stomacke, whether it be more or lesse, or sto∣mackes
that are full of humiditie, verie tender and queasie, and subject vnto chole∣ricke
vomits: so that in such complexions as are hot and cholericke, it is needfull as
with Wine, so vvith Cider to mixe water in a sufficient quantitie; vvith sweet Cider
vvhen they take it to drinke, especially when such persons haue any ague vvithall, or and if it be the hot time of Summer: foreseene, that he that shall then drinke it
thus, be not subiect to the paines of the bellie, or collicke; because that sweet Cider,
pressed new from sweet Apples, is windie by nature, as are also the sweet Apples
themselues. This is the cause why Physitians counsell and aduise, that sweet Apples
should be rosted in the ashes for them which shall eat them, that so their great moist∣nesse
and waterishnesse, which are the original fountaine of their windinesse, may
be concocted by the meanes of the heat of the fire. Vpon the same occasion it falleth
out, that neither sweet Apples nor sweet Cider can be good for them that are subiect
to distillations and rhewmes, because of their windinesse, and for that likewise, that
as the Arabian Physitians doe iudge, they breed great store of windinesse in the
muscles and sinewes, which cannot be discussed but with great paine and continu∣ance
of time. Amongst the sweet Ciders, the best and most wholesome are those
which are made of these Apples, the Hero•t, sweet Kennet, Curtaine, and Range∣let,
because these Appl•s are verie sweet, of a golden colour, good smell, and long
lasting.

Sowre Cider,* whether it were made such by reason of the sowrenesse of the Ap∣ples,
or become such by reason of the space of time, in as much as it is verie wa•rie,
and somewhat earthie, as also verie subtill and piercing, and yet therewithall some∣what
astringent and corroboratiue; becommeth singular good to coole a hot liuer
and stomacke, and to temper the heat of boyling and cholericke bloud, to stay cho∣ler
and adust vomiting, to asswage thirst, to cut and make thinne grosse and slimie
humors, whether hot or cold, but chiefely the hot. Such drinke falleth out to be verie
good and conuenient, and to serue well in place of wine, for such as haue anie Ague,
for such as are subiect to a hot liuer and hot bloud, for such as are scabbed, or itchie,
for such as are rheumaticke, vpon occasion of hot humors, and it needeth not that it
should be tempered with water. Of sowre Ciders, those are the most wholesome
which are made of sharpe sowre Apples, as of Rundockes, Ramburs, and sowre
Kennets.

The Cider that is harsh and rough,* in as much as it is verie cold and drie, is not
good, but after a long time, as namely, not before that it haue lost his harshnesse,
changing this his great coldnesse and drinesse into a meane and middle coldnesse,
accompanied with some moisture, drawing thereby neere vnto some kind of sweet∣nesse
or tart and pleasant sharpenesse: as we see it come to passe in fruits, which yet,
whiles they are not ripe, haue a certaine kind of harshnesse in them, but comming
to be ripe, change by little and little their harshnesse into an eager tartnesse, and after
into a pleasant sweetnesse. Wherefore such Ciders would not be drunke till of a long
while after they be made: or if that great necessitie should compell, then to allay
them with a sufficient quantitie of water; for otherwise, they would but cause costi•e∣nesse,
the strangurie, shortnesse of breath, and an infinite number of obstructions:
yea, they would procure manifold crudities in the stomacke, guts, and principall
veines: yea, they would ouerthrow a weake stomacke, beget a grosse, cold, and fleg∣maticke
bloud in the liuer, send vp manie thicke vapours vnto the braine, which
would offend the head, and hurt the sinewes and ioints: but it is as true, that they
〈◊〉 this commoditie with them, as to comfort the languishing stomacke, the qu•a∣sie
stomacke, and that which hath altogether lost his appetite, such as commonly be∣•ideth
women hauing newly conceiued, and strange appetites, for which this Cider
is verie fit and conuenient: as also to stay excessiue vomiting, all sorts of fluxes of the
belly, all distillations also, falling downe vpon the ioints: it quieteth the beating of
the heart, and cutteth off faintings: it helpeth digestion, drunke at the end of meat,
so that (as we haue said) it be allayed with a little water, to diminish and reforme the
heauinesse and slownesse to pierce and passe away which is in it; following the coun∣sell
of Galen, who teacheth three manner of waies to vse sowre and binding Apples
and Peares, without ani• preiudicing of the health: the first way being to boile them
in 〈◊〉, that so they may get more moistnesse and softnesse: the second, to set them
in the breath and vapour of boyling water, to moisten and ripen them: and the third being to cut them in the middest, and to take away their core, and in place thereof to
put honey or sugar, and then afterward to roast them amongst the hot ashes. These
kinds of Ciders are made principally of the Apples called small Ruddocke, of wild
Apples, not grafted nor husbanded, of Apple Bequet, Rellet, and such other, hauing
their coats diuersly spotted.

Ciders without all tast* become such by reason of their great waterishnesse, and are
easily corrupted, and that not onely in their vessels, but also being drunken and vsed
for drinke; and therefore there is no reckoning to be made of such.

As concer•ing Ciders hauing seuerall tasts,* as •ager and sweet, harsh and sweet, or
anie such other medley; the eager sweet are much better and more wholsome than the
harsh sweet, because they are not onely more pleasant, but also more speedily passing,
piercing, and cutting, than the other; which by reason of their harshnesse, ioyned
with some sweetnesse, and causing a thicknesse and heauinesse in them, abide and
stay long about the principall parts, where they may cause crudities and manie ob∣structions.

As for the age and lasting of Ciders; such as are new made, and continue as yet
troubled, not being fined, are not wholesome, and cannot be drunke without 〈◊〉
vnto the stomacke, without head-ach, and an infinite companie of obstructions and
other accidents, tedious to the health. For such as are verie sowre, and begin apace to
turne tart and eager, they are not lesse hurtfull than the former, and therefore they
must not be vsed but when they are well fined, and in their middleage, as wee see it
obserued in wine.

As concerning the compounding of them; those are the best, most wholesome,
and easiest to be digested, which are made of verie ripe Apples, gathered in due
time, and not ouer-long kept, which are likewise made of one onely kind of Ap∣ples,
or else of manie kinds, but either agreeing in tast; or else being of a a diuers tast,
yet are such as may be tempered together, and make a more pleasant tast, than if they
were alone and seuerall: as for example, if one should mingle amongst sweet Apples
such as were eager and sharpe, such a medley would make a farre more pleasant Ci∣der,
and more profitable, than if either of the said sorts were alone. The Cider like∣wise
that is made of Apples onely, is better than that which is made of Apples and
Peares stamped and pressed together: better in like manner, and more wholesome,
are those which are made without water, than that which is made with water, seeing
water maketh it to lose his naturall tast, maketh it sowre and corrupt, and that it will
not last or endure long: wherefore it is better not to mix any water at all with it when
you make any, but rather at the time of drinking of it to dilay it, and powre in 〈◊〉
water, if necessitie require it, and according as there shall be any of the occasions 〈◊〉
mentioned.

The worst of the Ciders is that which is made of wild Apples, stampt and cast in∣to
a vessell with fountaine water in sufficient quantitie: and yet worse than this, is that
which is made of the dros•e remaining of the first pressing: as that also which is only
cast into a vessell with sufficient quantitie of water: Wherefore, seeing that Ciders,
how pleasant and excellent soeuer they be, affoord no such nourishment vnto the bo∣die
as is verie profitable for them, as we will handle more at large hereafter; hee tha•
will be carefull of his health, shall vse none but the best Ciders. Wee will speake••
gaine of the faculties of Cider in the sixt Booke, in the same place where wee 〈◊〉
speake of the faculties of Wine.
