# Overview

This is my first ever virtual submission so I will try to be as clear as possible to the purpose of each file and document. 

The submission presented here is a period reproduction Champleve style enamel from the Enamels of Limoges book. See page 93 of the Enamels of Limoges book for the reference. I also screenshotted the page and added it to the Google Drive folder where this documentation is located. Further, the only images of these medallions I could find were in the Enamels of Limoges book.
Thus, the original images are low resolution and I had to guess at some of the colors and linework, in addition to some of the color from the orginals having been lost.

The "Three Medallions Decorated with Birds" were originally produced in the third quarter of the 12th century.[@ENAMEL:1] These medallions use several different solid colors with some blending in the same cloisens. The original medallions have four holes each that were likely drilled a significant time after their creation. The original mounting was in a bezel similarly to many other Limoges enamels that were attached to boxes in period. I likewise repurposed the mounting and intend to use these primarily as necklace or pin based decoration.


# Bird Medallion Background

As indicated above, the time period of this re-production champleve enamel is the late 12th century.[@ENAMEL:1] The original medallions are very ornate birds drawn and engraved onto the metal. They were engraved on copper and gilt (using fire gilding, which is extremely dangerous - see below) after being enameled with several colors: lapis and lavender blue, emerald and meadow green, and garnet red. It appears that these medallions were used to adorn some coffret.

According to the Limoges book, the origin of these medallions isn't certain. These birds are very similar to the design of birds that were found on artifacts from Silos in Spain, and on other isolated medallions. Further, the ornamentation of the birds matches the ornamentation on the Chasse of Champagnat (https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/464559) from France, which amplifies the uncertainty of their origin. Ultimately, these medallions incorporate styles that can be seen all over Europe. 

## Medieval Procedure - generalized

> Note, more detailed information can be found in the attached document `enamel_procedure_general.pdf`

1. Clean metal to prepare for engraving
2. Scribe desired picture onto the surface
3. Using hand gravers or hammers and chisels, engrave surfaces deep
   enough for enamel to be packed (0.5mm - 0.8mm)
4. Prepare enamel for packing
    * This was done using lump enamel (large chunks of glass) that was
      ground in a pestle and mortar to the appropriate grain size.
5. Moisten enamel and pack into the cloisens on the surface of the metal
6. When sufficiently packed, fire enamel in furnace
7. After cooling, re-pack and re-fire enamel as necessary to completely
   fill the metal
8. Polish metal

# Reproduction Medallions

These medallions were created using a combination of modern and medieval methods. The documents included with this one show the background process in much greater details with a detailed process (with a comparison between modern and medieval) and photograph document. Thus, this section will be lightly abbreviated.

The colors were matched as close as possible to the originals using the pictures as a guide. The colors listed in the Limoges book could not be found exactly, so the following colors were used:

* All were unleaded enamels from Thompson Enamels
* Cobalt Blue
* Harvest Blue
* Jungle Green
* Harvest Green
* Flame Red

## Modern Procedure - generalized

> Note, more detailed information can be found in the attached document `enamel_procedure_general.pdf`

1. The images were drawn using Adobe Illustrator to trace them into vectors so they could be printed as a resist for etching. 
2. After the resist was applied to copper disks they were submerged in etchant to remove the metal which created cloisens onto which enamel could be placed.  
3. The metal was then cleaned to remove any contaminates that would damage the glass.
4. The enamel powder was washed and wetted a bit to help fill the cloisens.
5. After sufficient enamel was applied the medallion was placed into a 1450 F kiln to melt the glass.
6. After the metal cools, the firescale and excess glass was removed.
7. Step 4 - 6 are repeated until the enamel and metal are flush and form a smooth surface.
8. Polish

# Challenges

These birds were challenging to create largely because of their ornate nature and, more importantly, the amount of colors in small spaces that were used. This is my first project where I had to do this so it required some special attention. 

All of the enamels react differently when exposed to the heat of the kiln multiple times and durations. In particular, the Jungle Green is particularly sensitive and tends to turn black very easily - much faster than any of the other colors. 

Because of the complexity of the coloring and design, the enamel had to be applied in different sections in small amounts to be fired many more times than most enamels. Care also had to be taken to fire the Jungle Green as few times as possible. 

## Miscellaneous Differences

A lot of the tools I use are likewise different than what is described in period manuals and artwork. However, unless otherwise described they are functionally similar. Something to note is that in medieval workshops these tasks all would be divided amongst a team of metal workers. By contrast, the work is done mostly by me and occasionally a few helpers (especially for the art). We're able to accomplish a lot with only a few people with the methods we use to enamel.

Also, the enamel powder we use is likely more consistent as well, and possibly uses different additives to create the various colors. I typically use 80 mesh enamel and don't have to worry about sifting any myself. Medieval enameling was done, as mentioned above, using lump enamel. This has to be broken up and sifted to the proper size. However, it is generally still placed using wet inlay.

One really important detail is that the enameling that I do is not gilded at all. It's a pretty obvious color difference in the finishing, and there are two major reasons for that. First, gilding done in period was done with a gold and mercury amalgamation in a process called Fire Gilding. The process is described in Theophilus' book On Divers Arts, and is briefly described here: gold and mercury were combined together and rubbed over the metal to be gilded. When sufficient, the mercury was vaporized in a furnace which left the gold behind. Mercury vapor is highly poisonous and is thus not done. The second important reason these enamels aren't gilded is because it's expensive. Modern gilding is typically done using electroplating. The setup and solutions are very expensive, and paying a shop to do it is likewise prohibitively expensive. 

However, overall the finished enamel is very similar to what was produced in period.
