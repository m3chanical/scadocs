# Theme of the Competition 

The theme of the competition is described as follows:

> The Kingdom of Navarre is located in the Basque Region and has rich cultural traditions. The first of the two competitions is to highlight this unique region in any medium of your choice. Documentation is not required but strongly encouraged. 

My take on the theme was to use my skills in vitreous enameling in
Champleve style to create a grape medallion which represents the rich
winemaking tradition of the Navarre region.

# Tempranillo Grapes and Winemaking in Rioja

The reason the grape enamel was chosen is because 
Navarre has a centuries (millenia even!) long history of winemaking and
is most well known for the Tempranillo grape grown heavily in the Rioja
DOC. The wine produced here is aged in oak for long periods (can be
determined by wine classification - Crianza, Riserva, etc.) and tastes
velvety, leathery, and with hints of red fruit. Tempranillo is often
called Spain's "Noble Grape." 

The Navarre and Rioja region have a history of winemaking dating back to 
the Phoenicians. Indeed, Tempranillo has been grown here for centuries.
The earliest written evidence of grape harvesting in this region is around 873
from a document by Sam Millan.

The King of Navarre and Aragon provided initial legal recognition of the
Rioja region in 1102. Rioja began exporting their wine in the 13th
century - indicating commercial production. From then on, Rioja focused
on wine.
