# Background

This document provides a list of pictures used as a reference for the
Plique-a-Jour (PaJ) enameling project that was submitted for the Tempore
Atlantia competition at 12th Night. The attempt was my very first and the goal was to reproduce the window of a 1400 cup called the Merode Cup from France. 
This document shows a basic overview of the PaJ process as well.

![The window in this cup is what I attempted to reproduce. The process to create it and an explanation of what differs can be seen in a different document.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel60.jpg)

![Image of Merode Cup window glued on top of 16ga copper.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel49.jpg)

![Saw threaded through copper to remove negative space.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel50.jpg)

![Merode Cup window fully cut out and ready for Plique-a-Jour.[^1]](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel51.jpg)

[^1]: Goldsmithing and Sculpture, Ch. 2. Cellini writes about how the Plique-a-Jour process is done when describing a filigree bowl. It is different than what is done here.

![Copper window with backing applied. The backing is very thin copper sheet.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel52.jpg)

![Negative space filled with wet enamel before drying and firing in the kiln at 1450 F. This is the first run through the kiln.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel53.jpg)

![PaJ window after the first run through the kiln. Notice how much lower the enamel has become due to fusing.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel54.jpg)

![Window just before the last run through the kiln. It must be run through the kiln several times to fully fill the spaces with enamel](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel55.jpg)

![Window after final firing. Light shone through behind to display characteristics.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel56.jpg)

![While polishing, a lot of the glass cracked. ](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel57.jpg)

![Window was fired one final time to re-fuse the broken glass, but without a backing. Without the rear support, the glass sank through.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel58.jpg)

![This is the start of the second window, since the first one didn't meet expectations.](../refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel59.jpg)
