# Background

This document provides a list of pictures used as a reference for the
general enameling procedure I use and have been working on refining.
The intent is that these pictures provide reasonable insight on how this
enameling process goes and serve as pictorial notes that will help the
reader visualize what occurs over the course of enameling.

![Sample Illustrator file of Medallions drawn by Rajan (Anya). These will be printed on Press-n-Peel (PnP) paper to be transferred.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel38.png)

![Example of drawing printed onto PnP (Art by Brose - this is her sheet). This must be printed with a laser printer. Inkjet will not work.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel37.jpg)

![Resist Applied to copper with PnP Blue. Testor's paint was used to fill in the gaps and seal the metal to the foam block](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel39.JPEG)

![Yew Bow medallion in the etchant bath. Notice how the resist is preventing the rest of the metal from dissolving](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel2.JPEG)

![Etched copper cleaned and awaiting wet enamel packing](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel23.JPEG)

![White Scarf medallions in the process of packing. Notice the enamel is wet, which aids in the process](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel42.JPEG)

![Two grape medallions on the right are dry and ready to be fired. If the enamel is too wet when it goes into the kiln the water vaporizes and interferes with enamel quality](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel43.JPEG)

![On the left, stoned and cleaned medallions ready for flash firing. On the right, medallions just out of the kiln. The fire scale is present and the enamel is slightly dark](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel4.JPEG)

![This red color just out of the kiln is black which can be seen in the previous image, but as it cools it goes back into this red. Notice how dark spots remain on the upper medallion - a sign that the red enamel is too thin](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel5.JPEG)

![Yew Bow and MoD medallions after stoning and light sanding. Stoning grinds excess glass to reveal detail and level. Additionally, these two are good quality. The detail of the Yew Bow shows really nicely and its surface is smooth and shiny](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel6.JPEG)

![Tempranillo grape medallion and a hops medallion. These two are examples of good quality enameling. The surface is shiny and the glass and metal are smooth across the entire surface](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel46.jpg)

![These medallions are medieval reproductions from the Enamels of Limoges Book. [@ENAMEL:1] See the next image for the book page. The medallion on the left has several flaws. The yellow enamel is finicky, the image is backward, and grid marks are present from where the heat transfer failed. The medallion on the right is in a similar state. Both need further processing](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/bacchus9.jpg)

![This is an image from the Enamels of Limoges book.[^1] These quatrefoil medallions provided the art and inspiration for the enamels in the previous image.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/quatrefoil_medallions.png)

![This White Scarf medallion was in the etchant bath for too long. Not good.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel31.JPEG)

![A crack in the enamel is visible on the bottom along with a low enamel spot on the right side. This is the result of several factors: etch too deep, inconsistent doming, and inconsistent resist applied](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel34.jpg)

![In addition to the PnP transfer paper, we use these tools to finish up the resist prior to etching. Testor's paint (any is fine, just not metallic!) is used to seal the metal and paint what the PnP missed. The paintbrush is used to application. The steel 'needle tool' is used for scratching away resist to provide enhances detail](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel48.jpg)

![These are what are used to pack the enamel onto the metal surface. The red enamel here is placed into a 2 oz condiment container (this prevents the main stock from becoming contaminated). The steel paddle tool is used to transfer enamel to the container. The needle tool is used again here to apply enamel in detail to the surface. Next to it is a wooden dowel with a darning needle, also used to apply enamel. A small paintbrush is also used for the same purpose](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel47.jpg)
