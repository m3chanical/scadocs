# Background

This document provides a list of pictures used as a reference for the
general enameling procedure I use and have been working on refining.
Hopefully these pictures provide reasonable insight on how this
enameling process goes.

![Sample Illustrator file of Medallions drawn by Rajan (Anya). These will be printed on Press-n-Peel (PnP) paper to be transferred.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel38.png)

![Example of drawing printed onto PnP (Art by Brose - this is her sheet). This must be printed with a laser printer. Inkjet will not work.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel37.jpg)

![Resist Applied to copper with PnP Blue. Testor's paint was used to fill in the gaps and seal the metal to the foam block](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel39.JPEG)

![Yew Bow medallion in the etchant bath. Notice how the resist is preventing the rest of the metal from dissolving](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel2.JPEG)

![Etched copper cleaned and awaiting wet enamel packing](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel23.JPEG)

![White Scarf medallions in the process of packing. Notice the enamel is wet, which aids in the process](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel42.JPEG)

![Two grape medallions on the right are dry and ready to be fired. If the enamel is too wet when it goes into the kiln the water vaporizes and interferes with enamel quality](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel43.JPEG)

![Yew Bow and MoD medallions after stoning and light sanding. Stoning grinds excess glass to reveal detail and level](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel6.JPEG)

![On the left, stoned and cleaned medallions ready for flash firing. On the right, medallions just out of the kiln. The fire scale is present and the enamel is slightly dark](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel4.JPEG)

![This red color just out of the kiln is black which can be seen in the previous image, but as it cools it goes back into this red. Notice how dark spots remain on the upper medallion - a sign that the red enamel is too thin](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel5.JPEG)

![This medallion has several flaws. The yellow enamel is finnicky, the image is backward, and grid marks are present from where the heat transfer failed](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel3.JPEG)

![This White Scarf medallion was in the etchant bath for too long. Not good.](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel31.JPEG)

![A crack in the enamel is visible on the bottom along with a low enamel spot on the right side. This is the result of several factors: etch too deep, inconsistent doming, and inconsistent resist applied](/home/statemachine/Documents/website/refskeggbrewing.github.io/assets/images/enamel34.jpg)
