# Acknowledgement

Special attention must be paid to both Marta De Lyon and Cailin
Blackwood. Their assistance was instrumental in bringing the enamel
medallions to life.

Further, Bronwen Rose (a.k.a. Brose) has been a wonderful teacher and
intensely supportive of this endeavor. Without her none of this would be
possible.

# Abstract

Presented here are several pieces of enamel done in Champlevè style.
There are several different enamels done with the theme of alcohol, each
representing a different type of drink. There are also a few Thyrsus
medallions, representing the followers of Bacchus and the aspects of
life they support: hedonism, partying, and good fun. 

The following is an overview of the process to create the enamel: 

1. A design was created in Adobe Illustrator. 
2. That design was applied to the copper disk as a resist for etching. 
3. Etching.
4. Cleaning and de-oxidizing the metal. 
5. The enamel was packed and the piece placed in the kiln. 
6. Polishing. 

What follows is an in depth discussion on how Champlevè enamel was
created in period, and a detailed explanation on how the designs relate
to Bacchus. 

See associated docs for technical information on the drawing, etching, and enameling process.

# The Maenads and the Thyrsus

Maenads were Bacchus' posse. They carried Thyrsus. The Thyrsus is a symbol of hedonism.
