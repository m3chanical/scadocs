# Overview

The way copper is usually etched is done using products easily obtained for home
use. We usually follow standard PCB etching procedures using
press-n-peel paper, an iron or heat press, an ferric chloride. Ferric
Chloride is not easy to dispose of properly, and it requires careful
handling procedure. Over the weekend of April 19, 2019, we (Brose and I) experimented
a bit with a couple different etching styles and compared their results. 

The two etchants we attempted were:
* Ammonium Persulfate
    * This is sold as a PCB etchant, and unfortunately there isn't a
      whole lot of information about it. This was diluted according to
      package instructions.
* Salt water etch
    * This involves a 1:5 salt water bath with a steel wire, copper, and
      current.

> with these methods, so we're unsure of the effectiveness on pure copper.

Overall the experimentation was a failure. However, we indeed
learned a lot. It's absolutely possible that these etchants would be much more
successful with pure copper. I'd like to try the salt water etch again
using only copper. We also learned that basically using ferric chloride provides the most
consistent and quality results, so in the future we will seek to improve
our methods using it. 

# Ammonium Persulfate

this stuff is weird.

# Salt Water Etch

instructables. two batteries not enough. used ac/dc adapter (9v 100mA)
and it worked. made sure polarity is correct. not bad. might be better
with pure copper.
