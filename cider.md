# Overview

Charles Estienne's (1504 - 1564) book The Covntrey Farm [@MEAD:5] is a 
treatise that describes, in part, how cider was made on his French orchard, 
and that is the drink presented here today. Below will be the recipe, a 
summary of Estienne's cider process, the process I followed, and then a 
comparison between the two.

The text of the book indicates a date of 1572, and another source (both found
simply by Googling the name of the book and author) indicates that the book
was published in 1583. Those dates aren't too drastically dissimilar that
some variation isn't a major issue. 

Essentially the cider was fermented using modern methods and a pure yest
strain, but was executed similarly to the process described in Estienne's
1564 treatise. Overall, the cider ended dry and retained much of the apple
qualities one would expect. The cider is still because it fermented to
completion in the carboy, and no priming sugar was added during bottling. 
This was done to more accurately reflect a period brewing process and
taste.

# Estienne's Procedure

The full text of Estienne's cider making process will be attached in an
appendix. What follows is a summary of his description. 

*   Cider must be made from apples that are grown (not wild!) for flavor,
    juiciness, aroma, and firm flesh. He puts some effort into describing
    methods by which one should manage an orchard. 
*   Apples gathered on a sunny September day.
*   Pile the apples (preferably in a roofed protected area) and leave for a
    month to fully ripen. If freezing occurs, cover apples with cloths or
    straw. 
*   Break the apples up by grinding into small pieces using a mill with one
    or two millstones of heavy wood or stone, with an ox or horse for
    power.
*   Apple pulp is then transferred to clean vats and allowed to "work for a
    time as wine does." 
*   The best juice is drawn into casks (white wine casks preferred) without
    pressing. Juice that comes voluntarily without pressing is the best,
    strongest, and sweetest cider. 
*   In dry years, small amounts of water added to the pulp improves the
    product. 
*   The pulp is pressed to extract the juice. Estienne comments that the
    pressed and unpressed juices should not be mixed. Instead, ferment
    separately so one can obtain a premium cider and a good quality cider.
*   The remaining pulp can be mixed with water, allowed to steep for
    another day, and then re-pressed to make a small drink for the
    household.
*   The partly fermented juices are transferred into casks and allowed to
    ferment with the bung left open for several days to purge froth, scum,
    and other impurities from the cask. 
*   When foaming stops, bung should be tightly bunged.

Cider taste considerations: 

*   Young Cider is sweet; old cider is sharper and, similar to wine, the
    oldest is the least sweet, but can be stored for two to three years.
*   Casks must be cleaned as soon as possible to prevent rotting.
*   Sour apples yield more juice than sweet ones and cider made with a
    mixture or the two is sourer, but may be preferred to drink in hot
    weather. 
*   Cider that is made without water clears more slowly than that made
    with water. 

# My Procedure

### Ingredients 

*   Apples
    *   The cider is made from the juice of mixed cultivated apples from
        the Beardsley Orchards Cider Mill in Shelton, CT. The exact mix is
        unknown, but Beardsley grows Honeycrisp, Macoun, Cortland, Mutsu,
        Jonagold, Empire, Red Delicious, McIntosh, Winesap,  Braeburn, and
        Fuji apples. These apples are grown for flavor, aroma, pleasant
        taste.
*   Yeast
    *   Wyeast 4766 Cider.
    *   Note: This is a pure yeast culture of unspecified country of origin
        and strain. Wine and champagne yeasts can also be used for cider,
        but have a tendency to produce drier and more alcoholic beverages.

### Process

January 6, 2018:

*   Six gallons of the pressed apples were allowed to warm to room 
    temperature (approx 70 F). 
*   Cider was transferred to a clean and sanitized six-gallon glass carboy.
*   Yeast pitched. 
*   Airlock added and let sit to ferment in a 70 F room. 

March 22, 2018

*   Cleaned and sanitized approx. 30 wine and swing-top bottles
*   Cleaned and sanitized bottling equipment.
    *   Siphon, hoses, bottle wand
*   Transferred cider to wine bottles and corked. 

# Comparison of Estienne's and Edgar's Processes

### Similarities

*   Both processes use cultivated apples known for sweetness, armoa, and
    pleasant qualitied. 
*   Apples for both were processed by milling and pressing to separate
    juice from the pulp.
*   Estienne's and my processors allowed juices to ferment at atmospheric
    pressure
*   Both ciders were transferred to sealed vessels for aging and storage.

### Differences

*   The juice I used was made from freshly picked apples that were not fully
    ripened for a month.
*   The apples I used were milled and pressed in a single operation, rather
    than two occasions as specified by Estienne.
*   The juice was kept in a glass carboy under an airlock for the duration
    of fermentation up until bottling. Period fermentation was usually done
    in an open vat prior to pressing, and partially in an unsealed cask
    (with bung removed or covered with cheesecloth). The cask limits
    contact with air, and the open bung vents CO2, which fulfills a similar
    purpose to modern airlocks. 
*   Estienne's process uses the natural yeast found on apple skins. I used
    the pure culture due to uncertainty in whether the UV treatment killed
    off the present yeast.
